# Check Your Weather (OpenWeather API)

This code will allow the user to access a weather report of the city name they enter in the application. 

## Features

2. Dotenv: Loads environment variables from .env for nodejs projects.
3. Body-Parser: Node.js body parsing middleware.

including the description, temperature, and an image of the current weather condition.
